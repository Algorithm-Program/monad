Build Tree
==========
You can build binary tree by any two traversal.
--------------------------------------------------
### Build tree by Pre-Order and In-Order
#### Description
	"By pre_order and in_order.cpp" is an example. It reads pre-order and in-order about the tree, and then it builds a tree by linked list. Finally, it output the post-order about the tree.
#### Sample Input
	4 1 2 3 5 6
	2 1 3 4 6 5
#### Sample Output
	2 3 1 6 5 4
### Build tree by In-Order and Post-Order
#### Description
	"By in_order and post_order.cpp" is an example. It reads in-order and post-order about the tree, and then it builds a tree by linked list. Finally, it output the pre-order about the tree.
#### Sample Input
	2 1 3 4 6 5
	2 3 1 6 5 4
#### Sample Output
	4 1 2 3 5 6
